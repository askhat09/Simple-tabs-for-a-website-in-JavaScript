					<img src="img/avocados.jpg"> <h1>Avocados: Health Benefits, Calories and Nutrition</h1>
					<p>Avocados are a paradox: they are technically a fruit, but they taste more like a vegetable. They are low in sugar and high in fat which is rare for fruits. Though they are high in fat, they are considered heart healthy and do not increase risk for weight gain.</p>
					<p>Avocados originate from Mexico, but now people around the world enjoy avocados as a regular part of their diet.  In fact, avocados are increasingly growing in demand.</p>
					<p>Indeed, the increase of avocado consumption is not just another hyped food trend, but there are many researched based health benefits avocados can provide.</p>
					<p>Avocados are very nutritious and can even be considered a superfood (although this term has no exact definition).</p>
					<p>A 2013 study found avocado consumption is associated with improved diet quality and higher intakes of some vitamins and minerals.</p>

					<img src="img/creatine.jpg"> <h1>Creatine: How it Works, Benefits and Side Effects</h1>
					<p>Creatine is one of the most popular supplements athletes take. It is a rare example of a supplement that has a lot of research behind its health claims. Many studies have shown taking creatine properly can increase muscle mass and strength.</p>
					<p>Creatine may offer another surprising benefit according to research: benefiting brain health and protecting against neurological diseases.  Creatine may positively affect other conditions such as diabetes, arthritis or depression but more research is needed.</p>
					<p>Despite popular opinion, side effects from taking creatine per guidelines are minimal.  Contrary to most supplements, long term use (3-5 years) has been shown to be safe for most populations.</p>
					<p>Providing your body with a higher level of creatine should translate to more energy being available for muscle cells for quick bursts of energy.</p>
					<p>The amount needed can vary depending on muscle mass size and exercise level.</p>

					<img src="img/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg"> <h1>Apple Cider Vinegar: Health Benefits but also Side Effects</h1>
					<p>Apple cider vinegar is considered a remedy for many ailments, but there is not always scientific validity for health claims.  Some research suggests it may play a role in weight loss, blood sugar regulation, heart health benefits or impacting cancer risk.</p>
					<p>Drinking apple cider vinegar in moderation (if you can stand the taste) may be safe and even beneficial for most people, but consuming excess is not recommended.</p>
					<p>Apple cider vinegar is acidic; therefore, consuming too much may cause tooth enamel erosion, irritation to the digestive tract or possibly weaken bones.</p>
					<p>Apple cider vinegar is not a magic bullet cure all for any health condition and adding it to your diet wonâ€™t guarantee weight loss or other major changes to your health.</p>
					<p>Apple cider vinegar is basically fermented apple juice.  Yeast gets added to apple juice which turns the sugar from apples into alcohol.</p>

					<img src="img/skim-milk.jpg"> <h1>Skim Milk: Health Benefits and Nutrition</h1>
					<p>Milk is considered a nutrient dense food.  It is a good source of protein, calcium, vitamin D, potassium and vitamin A.  What can vary in milk is the fat content with whole milk having the highest amount of fat and skim milk having the least amount.</p>
					<p>The main health message for milk intake for many years has been: drink 3 cups of milk per day and choose low-fat or non-fat (skim) milk.</p>
					<p>Choosing low fat or skim milk over full fat milk is a lower calorie choice and was thought to provide heart health benefits by being lower in saturated fat.</p>
					<p>Some health experts are now even calling into question if drinking milk is really even required for optimal nutrition.</p>
					<p>For example, people with lactose intolerance can get all nutrients from milk from other food sources.</p>
					<p>The carbohydrate, vitamin, mineral and protein content is the same or very similar between mainstream dairy milk options.</p>
